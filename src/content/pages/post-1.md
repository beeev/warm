## **The first challenge:** How do we connect and build relationships with buyers who no longer want to talk to you directly?

Over and over again with the B2B brands that I work with, we are told that 'it's all about the relationships and trust we have built up with our customers overtime' - but this masks a truth about connecting with new audiences. According to [6Sense 2024 B2B Buyer Experience Report](https://6sense.com/resources/buyer-experience-report/2024-b2b-buyer-experience-report) buyers make it 69% through their entire purchase journey before engaging with a seller. This indicates that the traditional sales-led relationships with customers are no longer the primary way that buyers will form preference, or trust.  


Our challenge, is to make our brands and products discoverable without being intrusive, far before our sales people get to talk to the potential customers. This is where TikTok, with its discovery-driven algorithm and engaging content format, presents an opportunity to not only reach buyers earlier but also connect in ways that feel authentic and human (and therefore, memorable).

This is exactly what John Deere are doing on TikTok. They've accumulated 566,000 followers on TikTok and recieved over 6,000,000 likes. They've humanised their communication by showing the whimsical daily routines of their CTO (chief tractor officer). While a lot of the content is a bit throwaway, there's some real gold in here - particularly how they have reshaped the traditional customer testimonial:

## **Challenge Two:** How do we make our brand the one buyers think of first, long before they actively start looking?

The next stat from 6Sense's report that grabbed my attention was that in 81% of cases, a B2B buyer has chosen their preferred vendor before taking to any sellers.This goes beyond just being visibleâ€”itâ€™s about staying top of mind and shaping preferences early, even when buyers arenâ€™t yet consciously considering their options. It's about clearly identifying category entry points, and creating discoverable content linked to those areas. 

That's another thing that John Deere are getting right on TikTok, often through customer testimonials that link the brand to key themes like reliability and efficiency.

## **Challenge Three:** How do we engage and influence a large group of decision-makers with different priorities and needs, without knowing exactly when or how each person will get involved?

6Sense's report show us that B2B buying groups for large purchases involves teams of 10-12 people. This means that we must create messages that speak to a wide variety of roles: technical experts, financial leaders, executives, and end users, each with their own priorities and concerns. 

And this is another area where John Deere's TikTok testimonials are impressing me. While it's likely that their videos are targeting the end-user - the videos do an excellent job of showing how other people are solving problems using John Deere equipment.
