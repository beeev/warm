Last week, I was watching my team get butchered by Manchester United. For Saints fans like me, the outlook is not good. We're on track for the lowest ever points total in Premier League history. Naturally, I found the advertisements more enjoyable than the feeling of impending doom unfolding on the pitch.

What caught my eye was an advert for the online bookkeeping service Xero.

There's a number of tactics they employ – all designed to gain and hold your attention:

## Rule One: Subvert Your Audience's Expectations

We are ‘satisficing’ creatures, choosing where to spend our limited attention. To pull people out of their routine and capture their focus, an advert must break predictions. The Xero advert does this expertly by taking a familiar setting—a marathon—and adding unexpected elements that jolt viewers out of their passive state. This surprise factor forces viewers to pay closer attention, making the ad more memorable and engaging.

### Rule Two: Evoke a Strong Emotional Response

Use of strong emotion is the single creative device most consistently linked with capturing attention. By making audiences laugh or feel inspired about just how easy it is to carry out the kind of mundane book-keeping tasks that Xero presumably enables they tap into a universal truth: people remember how an advert made them feel, not just what it said.

### Rule Three: Use Clear Branding

Advertising cannot have an impact if audience fail to attribute it to the correct brand. Surprisingly, literature suggests that more than half of all advertisements fail to make a clear link between the message and the brand. "Xero with an X" is a clever way of getting audiences to remember the brand.

However, what is perhaps most surprising is that the advert itself first aired at least three years ago. Yet it’s still finding a new audience today.
