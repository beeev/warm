I'm looking forward to following [APG's AI Content](https://www.apg.org.uk/ai) this year. They promise to look at the role of the strategist in the age of AI, how AI will help with effectiveness, and the importance of critical thinking when using AI. First though, is their [AI Toolkit](https://www.apg.org.uk/ai-toolkit), which lists 44 tools that strategists can add to their arsenal.

They've also been asking strategists about their 'AI Diet' - which is very thought-provoking. I thought I'd answer their questions here, and see if my diet changes over the coming year.

**What’s the first AI tool you fire up when you sit down to do work and what for?**

It's always ChatGPT. The way I use it was informed and inspired by Zoe Scaman's awesome _[Strategy in the Age of AI](https://www.canva.com/design/DAF_JFMQSX0/a_RRBMuSZ3Z9w-sKGgZe9g/view?utm_content=DAF_JFMQSX0&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=viewer)_ presentation. I like her little framework of Conversations, Context and Curiosity - and that's broadly what I use AI for in the day-to-day.

**Which AI tool is underrated in your opinion and why?**

Where ChatGPT is making me super human is in the field of analytics. I can talk to it about the data that I have and the kind of data discoveries that I'm after and it will - in beginner friendly terms - output Python code that I can run on my Mac. It's absolutely magical. It is like having a Data Scientist in my pocket.

**What AI tool are you most disappointed by and why?**

I found ChatGPT's ability to hold a voice-based conversation very upsetting. While talking to it, the assistant kept interrupting me, or not waiting until I was finished speaking before replying. Strangely, I found this very upsetting. I came away from it feeling very sad.

**What’s one piece of advice you’d give to other strategists when using AI?**

I would remind them that _Chat_ doesn't have to be about work. I've used it to help me learn more about jazz. Or understand more about film. It can enrich your life culturally as well.
