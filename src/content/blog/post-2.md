Working on investor relations content can be a challenge, partly because they are such an illusive bunch and it can be hard to get any solid research on this audience. In the past I've used [Brunswick's Digital Investor Survey](https://www.brunswickgroup.com/perspectives/digital-investor-survey/2023/) - but usually I'm reliant on my client to steer me in the right direction. That's why I was very interested to see this new report titled _[Business-to-Investor Marketing:The Interplay of Costly and Costless Signals](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00222429241288464)_ in my RSS feed: I was genuinely excited when I flicked through it - can this finally offer a framework to assess my own Investor Relations communication?

The language of their report takes a bit getting used to, but their main thrust is that you must carefully balance the 'costed' with the 'costless' and it is the interplay of these two things together that make for successful communication.

## First, some definitions:

**Costly Signals: The Foundation of Credibility**  
Costly signals refer to tangible, resource-based evidence that reduces uncertainty for investors. These are the substantive elements that prove a business is viable and capable of delivering results. Examples include:

• **Financial resources:** Strong balance sheets, growth metrics, or customer orders.

• **Social resources:** Teams with proven track records or leadership credibility.

• **Intellectual resources:** Investments in R&D, patents, or partnerships with trusted institutions.

**Costless Signals: Amplifying the Message**

Costless signals, on the other hand, shape how investors perceive the business. They are stylistic or emotional elements that help communicate the costly signals effectively. Two critical costless signals are:

• **Passion:** Enthusiasm, energy, and conviction that show belief in the company’s vision.

• **Concreteness:** Clear, vivid communication that makes achievements feel real. This involves providing evidence—numbers, milestones, and examples—in language that is relatable and easy to grasp. Concreteness doesn’t create new achievements but ensures existing ones are communicated in a way that inspires confidence.

Here is a diagram explaining from their model, illustrating their main theory, that _investor acceptance occurs when both the costless signals and the costly are in balance._

**Why Balance Matters**

The research shows that investor scepticism arises when these two signals are out of balance:

• Over-relying on **costless signals** (e.g., passion without proof) will feel like hollow hype.

• Overloading on **costly signals** (e.g., data without emotion) can fail to connect on a human level, leaving investors unmotivated.

In short, the paper shows that **investor relations rely on a balanced blend of hard evidence and engaging storytelling**. If you can’t boast hefty resources yet, share precise details of any successes you _do_ have; if you’re already on solid ground, fan the flames of ambition with strong, future-focused narratives. By recognising where you stand on the “costly vs. costless” spectrum, you can shape messages that meet investors exactly where _they_ need reassurance.

## The framework

To wrap it all up, I've botched together this 'Business-to-Investor Canvas, hopefully a simple tool that captures the essence of this new research. This might be a little bit of a cheat-sheet in crafting narratives that are more likely to resonate with the investor community. This is something that I'm going to try out in the following months:
